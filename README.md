# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

I am using this free data set found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/niharika41298/nutrition-details-for-most-common-foods/code. This data includes some nutirional fact 
about common foods found in the standard American Diet.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}
The purpose for writing this software is to prove my ability to develop software and build an analisys on said data when provided by a thrid party. In paricular, I wanted
to analyze some of the foods we eat on a daily basis and see if we can't make some better choices with our diet.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

Question 1: which foods should I be eating if I want to increase my protein intake and decrease my fat intake?

The dataset was quite large, so I broke it up by category and enabled a usre of the program to run the program form the command line, type in the category tey would like to view
and then return results based upon that category. Here is an example table of foods that have a high protein and low fat intake obtaine by running the program:


Question 2: what is the fat to protein ratio of these protein rich foods?
